## Physical Things I like and love

- [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com) (coffee): It's plastic, unbreakable,
  pretty in its own way, cheap, and makes amazing coffee. What's more to like!
- [Victorinox](https://victorinox.com) (pocket knife): Everyone should have a
  Swiss army knife, tailored to their specific requirements.
- [Casio](https://casio.com) (watch): Nerdy, aesthetically pleasing, and cheap
  but durable. You might start to notice a pattern here.

## Software I like and love

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) (editor): Duh
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (terminal multiplexer): 100x developer
